# My Analysis

The **Launch Notebook** badge at the top of this project opens the notebook
in the browser. (Badge is added automatically via group settings.)

## Usage

1. Edit `notebook.py` with `marimo edit notebook.py`
2. Put any data files in `data/` — they are auto-discovered at launch time
3. Push and click the Launch badge
