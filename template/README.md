# My Analysis

[![Launch Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch-Notebook-blue)](PAGES_URL/launch.html?project=PROJECT_ID)

## Setup

After creating your project from this template:

1. **Replace `PAGES_URL`** in the badge above with your marimo Pages site URL
   (e.g. `http://sccarey.cee-gitlab.lan/marimo-offline-pages`).
2. **Replace `PROJECT_ID`** with your project's numeric ID
   (Settings > General > Project ID), **or** just push once and CI will
   replace it automatically.
3. Edit `notebook.py` with `marimo edit notebook.py`.
4. Put any data files in `data/` — they are auto-discovered at launch time.
5. Click the badge to open the notebook in the browser.
